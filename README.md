# Data for Ru-loaded pyrrolic-N-doped extensively graphitized porous carbon for high performance electrochemical hydrogen evolution

Archive of data.  The data is calculated from SeqQUEST and JDFTx ab-initio quantum software.  They are used to calculate energy efficiencies and geometries of Ru Hydrogen Evolution Reaction catalyst on N-graphene support.

			XXX = pyrr (pyrrolic), graphe (graphene), graphi (graphitic), pyri (pyridinic)
				describes the support underneath the Ru39 metal
			# = The number representing how many of the surface sites (coverage) are occupied by hydrogen
			& = Different configurational isotopes for the coverage from a-f
